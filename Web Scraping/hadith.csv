search for it, and so did the people along with him. There was no water at that place, so the people 
went to Abu- Bakr As-Siddiq and said, ""Don't you see what `Aisha has done? She has made Allah's 
Apostle and the people stay where there is no water and they have no water with them."" Abu Bakr

Nothing prevented me from moving (because of pain) but the position of Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) on my thigh. 
Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) got up when dawn broke and there was no water. So Allah revealed the Divine Verses 
of Tayammum. So they all performed Tayammum. Usaid bin Hudair said, ""O the family of Abu Bakr! 
This is not the first blessing of yours."" Then the camel on which I was riding was caused to move 
from its place and the necklace was found beneath it.",3,Others
bukhari,8,Narrated Abu Dhar:,"Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""While I was at Mecca the roof of my house was opened and Gabriel descended, 
opened my chest, and washed it with Zamzam water. Then he brought a golden tray full of wisdom 
and faith and having poured its contents into my chest, he closed it. Then he took my hand and 
ascended with me to the nearest heaven, when I reached the nearest heaven, Gabriel said to the 
gatekeeper of the heaven, 'Open (the gate).' The gatekeeper asked, 'Who is it?' Gabriel answered: 
'Gabriel.' He asked, 'Is there anyone with you?' Gabriel replied, 'Yes, Muhammad I is with me.' He 
asked, 'Has he been called?' Gabriel said, 'Yes.' So the gate was opened and we went over the nearest 
heaven and there we saw a man sitting with some people on his right and some on his left. When he 
looked towards his right, he laughed and when he looked toward his left he wept. Then he said, 
'Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious son.' I asked Gabriel, 'Who is he?' He replied, 'He is Adam and 
the people on his right and left are the souls of his offspring. Those on his right are the people of 
Paradise and those on his left are the people of Hell and when he looks towards his right he laughs and 
when he looks towards his left he weeps.' 
Then he ascended with me till he reached the second heaven and he (Gabriel) said to its gatekeeper, 
'Open (the gate).' The gatekeeper said to him the same as the gatekeeper of the first heaven had said 
and he opened the gate. Anas said: ""Abu Dhar added that the Prophet (ﷺ) met Adam, Idris, Moses, Jesus 
and Abraham, he (Abu Dhar) did not mention on which heaven they were but he mentioned that he 
(the Prophet (ﷺ) ) met Adam on the nearest heaven and Abraham on the sixth heaven. Anas said, ""When 
Gabriel along with the Prophet (ﷺ) passed by Idris, the latter said, 'Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious 
brother.' The Prophet (ﷺ) asked, 'Who is he?' Gabriel replied, 'He is Idris."" The Prophet (ﷺ) added, ""I passed 
by Moses and he said, 'Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious brother.' I asked Gabriel, 'Who is he?' 
Gabriel replied, 'He is Moses.' Then I passed by Jesus and he said, 'Welcome! O pious brother and 
pious Prophet.' I asked, 'Who is he?' Gabriel replied, 'He is Jesus. 
Then I passed by Abraham and he said, 'Welcome! O pious Prophet and pious son.' I asked Gabriel, 
'Who is he?' Gabriel replied, 'He is Abraham. The Prophet (ﷺ) added, 'Then Gabriel ascended with me to a 
place where I heard the creaking of the pens."" Ibn Hazm and Anas bin Malik said: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, 
""Then Allah enjoined fifty prayers on my followers when I returned with this order of Allah, I passed 
by Moses who asked me, 'What has Allah enjoined on your followers?' I replied, 'He has enjoined 
fifty prayers on them.' Moses said, 'Go back to your Lord (and appeal for reduction) for your followers 
will not be able to bear it.' (So I went back to Allah and requested for reduction) and He reduced it to 
half. When I passed by Moses again and informed him about it, he said, 'Go back to your Lord as your 
followers will not be able to bear it.' So I returned to Allah and requested for further reduction and 
half of it was reduced. I again passed by Moses and he said to me: 'Return to your Lord, for your 
followers will not be able to bear it. So I returned to Allah and He said, 'These are five prayers and 
they are all (equal to) fifty (in reward) for My Word does not change.' I returned to Moses and he told 
me to go back once again. I replied, 'Now I feel shy of asking my Lord again.' Then Gabriel took me 
till we '' reached Sidrat-il-Muntaha (Lote tree of; the utmost boundary) which was shrouded in colors, 
indescribable. Then I was admitted into Paradise where I found small (tents or) walls (made) of pearls

go in seclusion (the cave of) Hira where he used to worship(Allah Alone) continuously for many 
(days) nights. He used to take with him the journey food for that (stay) and then come back to (his 
wife) Khadija to take his food like-wise again for another period to stay, till suddenly the Truth 
descended upon him while he was in the cave of Hira. The angel came to him in it and asked him to 
read. The Prophet (ﷺ) replied, ""I do not know how to read."" (The Prophet (ﷺ) added), ""The angel caught me 
(forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it anymore. He then released me and again 
asked me to read, and I replied, ""I do not know how to read,"" whereupon he caught me again and 
pressed me a second time till I could not bear it anymore. He then released me and asked me again to 
read, but again I replied, ""I do not know how to read (or, what shall I read?)."" Thereupon he caught 
me for the third time and pressed me and then released me and said, ""Read: In the Name of your Lord, 
Who has created (all that exists). Has created man from a clot. Read and Your Lord is Most 
Generous...up to..... ..that which he knew not."" (96.15) 
Then Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) returned with the Inspiration, his neck muscles twitching with terror till he 
entered upon Khadija and said, ""Cover me! Cover me!"" They covered him till his fear was over and 
then he said, ""O Khadija, what is wrong with me?"" Then he told her everything that had happened and 
said, 'I fear that something may happen to me."" Khadija said, 'Never! But have the glad tidings, for by 
Allah, Allah will never disgrace you as you keep good reactions with your Kith and kin, speak the 
truth, help the poor and the destitute, serve your guest generously and assist the deserving, calamityafflicted 
ones."" Khadija then accompanied him to (her cousin) Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad bin 
`Abdul `Uzza bin Qusai. Waraqa was the son of her paternal uncle, i.e., her father's brother, who 
during the Pre-Islamic Period became a Christian and used to write the Arabic writing and used to 
write of the Gospels in Arabic as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and had lost 
his eyesight. Khadija said to him, ""O my cousin! Listen to the story of your nephew."" Waraqa asked, 
""O my nephew! What have you seen?"" The Prophet (ﷺ) described whatever he had seen. 
Waraqa said, ""This is the same Namus (i.e., Gabriel, the Angel who keeps the secrets) whom Allah 
had sent to Moses. I wish I were young and could live up to the time when your people would turn 
you out."" Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) asked, ""Will they turn me out?"" Waraqa replied in the affirmative and said: 
""Never did a man come with something similar to what you have brought but was treated with 
hostility. If I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I would support you 
strongly."" But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine Inspiration was also paused for a while 
and the Prophet (ﷺ) became so sad as we have heard that he intended several times to throw himself from 
the tops of high mountains and every time he went up the top of a mountain in order to throw himself 
down, Gabriel would appear before him and say, ""O Muhammad! You are indeed Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) in 
truth"" whereupon his heart would become quiet and he would calm down and would return home. And 
whenever the period of the coming of the inspiration used to become long, he would do as before, but 
when he used to reach the top of a mountain, Gabriel would appear before him and say to him what he 
had said before. (Ibn `Abbas said regarding the meaning of: 'He it is that Cleaves the daybreak (from 
the darkness)' (6.96) that Al-Asbah. means the light of the sun during the day and the light of the 
moon at night).",3,Salat

he asked us about those whom we had left behind. When we informed him, he said, ""Go back to your 
families and stay with them and teach them (religion) and order them (to do good deeds). The Prophet (ﷺ) 
mentioned things some of which I remembered and some I did not. Then he said, ""Pray as you have

muslim,1,It is narrated on the authority of Yahya b. Ya'mur that the first man who discussedqadr(Divine Decree) in Basra was Ma'bad al-Juhani. I along with Humaid b. 'Abdur-Rahman Himyari set out for pilgrimage or for 'Umrah and said:,"Should it so happen that we come into contact with one of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) we shall ask him about what is talked abouttaqdir(Divine Decree). Accidentally we came across Abdullah ibn Umar ibn al-Khattab, while he was entering the mosque. My companion and I surrounded him. One of us (stood) on his right and the other stood on his left. I expected that my companion would authorize me to speak. I therefore said: Abu Abdur Rahman! There have appeared some people in our land who recite the Qur'an and pursue knowledge. And then after talking about their affairs, added: They (such people) claim that there is no such thing as Divine Decree and events are not predestined. He (Abdullah ibn Umar) said: When you happen to meet such people tell them that I have nothing to do with them and they have nothing to do with me. And verily they are in no way responsible for my (belief). Abdullah ibn Umar swore by Him (the Lord) (and said): If any one of them (who does not believe in the Divine Decree) had with him gold equal to the bulk of (the mountain) Uhud and spent it (in the way of Allah), Allah would not accept it unless he affirmed his faith in Divine Decree. He further said: My father, Umar ibn al-Khattab, told me: One day we were sitting in the company of Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) when there appeared before us a man dressed in pure white clothes, his hair extraordinarily black. There were no signs of travel on him. None amongst us recognized him. At last he sat with the Apostle (peace be upon him) He knelt before him placed his palms on his thighs and said: Muhammad, inform me about al-Islam. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Al-Islam implies that you testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah, and you establish prayer, pay Zakat, observe the fast of Ramadan, and perform pilgrimage to the (House) if you are solvent enough (to bear the expense of) the journey. He (the inquirer) said: You have told the truth. He (Umar ibn al-Khattab) said: It amazed us that he would put the question and then he would himself verify the truth. He (the inquirer) said: Inform me about Iman (faith). He (the Holy Prophet) replied: That you affirm your faith in Allah, in His angels, in His Books, in His Apostles, in the Day of Judgment, and you affirm your faith in the Divine Decree about good and evil. He (the inquirer) said: You have told the truth. He (the inquirer) again said: Inform me about al-Ihsan (performance of good deeds). He (the Holy Prophet) said: That you worship Allah as if you are seeing Him, for though you don't see Him, He, verily, sees you. He (the enquirer) again said: Inform me about the hour (of the Doom). He (the Holy Prophet) remarked: One who is asked knows no more than the one who is inquiring (about it). He (the inquirer) said: Tell me some of its indications. He (the Holy Prophet) said: That the slave-girl will give birth to her mistress and master, that you will find barefooted, destitute goat-herds vying with one another in the construction of magnificent buildings. He (the narrator, Umar ibn al-Khattab) said: Then he (the inquirer) went on his way but I stayed with him (the Holy Prophet) for a long while. He then, said to me: Umar, do you know who this inquirer was? I replied: Allah and His Apostle knows best. He (the Holy Prophet) remarked: He was Gabriel (the angel).
